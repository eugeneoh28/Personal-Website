            <p><strong>Positions Held:</strong>End Summer Hunger Campaign Corps</p>

            <h1 class="Title">Background</h1>
            <p>
              During the summer, 100,000 King County kids and families lose access to reliable the school meals are provided over the school year.
              The good news is that there is a federal program that provides free meals to kids and teens living
              in high poverty areas â€“ all summer long. The bad news is that only 10-14% of area children access free summer meals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This gap is the result of various barriers experienced only during the summer, including a lack of access to meal sites,
              insufficient program awareness, and limited resources when schools are closed.
            </p>
            <h1 class="Title">My Role</h1>
            <p>
              I served as a member of the End Summer Hunger Campaign Corps as a part of the AmeriCorps team during the summer of 2015.
              in this position I executed multiple roles including:
              <ul>
                <li>Acting as a Site Supervisor at multiple meal sites to distribute meals to low income children.</li>
                <li>Hosting and working multiple outreach events to spread the word about the program.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h1 class="Title">Future Goals</h1>
            <p>
              Although my AmeriCorps Term has ended, I wish to be able to serve again in the future and through this opportunity I have been
              able to learn more about other opportunities such as Dream Project and Huskies for Opportunities in Prison Education.
